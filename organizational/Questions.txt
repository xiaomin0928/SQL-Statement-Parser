Common: 
	1. Would it be helpfull to implement a function like "datastructure" similar to "toString" which prints out the Datastructure and whats saved into it? 

For Dennis:
	1. Do we need to return a whole string like " select: Objecttype/Attribute" 
		or is it sufficient to return the Data Structure where everything is saved. 
		-> Both save in datastructure and implement a "to.string" function which outputs the saved information into string ( override toString() = ... ) 
		
	2. How can we distinguish several sql statements in one call? Will there only 
		be one Statement per call or is it possible that there will be for example
		two statements in one call? If the latter, how will the be seperated by 
		one another? 
		-> Only One, but it can be happen that we have a UNION etc. 
		-> All in one line (white space doenÂ´t matter at all in parser combinator) 
		-> semicolon at the end is optional. (not to be saved in the representation) 
		-> Check for E of String by 
		def EOI: Parser[Any] = new Parser[Any] {
			def apply(in: Input) = {
			if (in.atEnd) new Success("EOI", in)
			else Failure("end of input expected", in)
			}
		}
